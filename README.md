# ytradio
A simple http radio station with youtubei.js.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yonle/ytradio
cd ytradio
npm install
```

## Starting
```
node index.js
```

## Configuring
Put your Song URL at `yturl.txt` when needed, atleast 1 URL is enough. 
More than that could cause some crash as we only read 1 URL.

To listen in different port, set `PORT` Environment variable before starting the server.
